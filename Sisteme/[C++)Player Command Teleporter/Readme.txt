Hello world last night at around 5 am bored me and I created a short teleport order in minutes.

What is this order?

- Order can be used for teleporting a player.
- By accessing the / teleport <number> you have to choose one of the numbers that are in the map settings.
- Each map has a configuration proposed for the minimum and maximum level.

- You can teleport a map if you do not have the required minimum.
- You can teleport a map if you level higher than the configuration map.
- List of papers default starts from 1 to 13.
- You can not enter a number less than 1.
- You can not enter a number greater than 13.
- You can not enter characters than numbers.
- When you tried to use the command without arguments will show the list as the number of error information, as well as where you enter a character or use / teleport show_list.

 You can add as many maps you want.
- Everything is configurable.
- Must have knowledge of C++ 0.1% to add more maps.
